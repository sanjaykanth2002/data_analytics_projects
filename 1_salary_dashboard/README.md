####  Count of Job Schedule Type

=FILTER(J2#,(NOT(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("and",J2#))+ISNUMBER(SEARCH(",",J2#))))*(J2#<>0))
```

- **Unique List Generation:** This Excel formula below employs the `FILTER()` function to exclude entries containing "and" or commas, and omit zero values.
- ** Formula Purpose:** This formula populates the table below, which gives us a list of unique job schedule types.



####  Filtered List

-  **Enhanced Data Validation:** Implementing the filtered list as a data validation rule under the `Job Title`, `Country`, and `Type` option in the Data tab ensures:
    -  User input is restricted to predefined, validated schedule types
    -  Incorrect or inconsistent entries are prevented
    - Overall usability of the dashboard is enhanced
